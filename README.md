By accepting special promotional offers like the one mentioned above, you can receive a large number of spins instantly. Coin Master often offers bonuses through special deals, apps, or offers to new and active players. These offers often appear as pop-ups or notifications within the game. Be sure to check your game notifications and email regularly to catch these deals before they expire!

#### **1.2. Spin Every Hour**

Coin Master allows players to spin the slot machine a limited number of times every day, but you can earn more spins by waiting for the hourly refresh. Make sure you log into the game regularly and spin whenever possible. This can add up over time, especially if youâ€™re consistent.

### 2. How to Use Free Spins and Coins Effectively

While accumulating spins is essential, itâ€™s equally important to use them wisely. Hereâ€™s how to make the most of your spins:

#### **2.1. Focus on Raids and Attacks**

Spins in Coin Master allow you to raid other players' villages or attack them to collect coins, which you can use to upgrade your village. These actions help you progress faster. Make sure to prioritize using spins on these features rather than simply collecting coins.

#### **2.2. Donâ€™t Waste Spins on Pets**

Although pets are useful, they can be a drain on your spins. If you're aiming to reach 10,000 spins, focus on maximizing the value of each spin through raids, attacks, and building. Save your pet-related spins for when you really need them.

#### **2.3. Use Spins to Complete Village Stages**

Coin Master progresses through multiple village stages. You need a significant amount of spins to complete each stage, but having a strategy will allow you to advance faster. Donâ€™t waste spins on unnecessary items or upgrades that donâ€™t align with your immediate goals.
